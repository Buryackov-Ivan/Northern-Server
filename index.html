  <h2>Welcome to Northern Server!</h2>
  <p>
Welcome to my first website created with the help of "Lektor". This website was created as part of the laboratory work on the course "Computer Workshop". Here you can see some information about me, information about where you can write to me and see my previous and future works.
</p>
<p>
I hope you will be pleased to be on this site. I apologize in advance for the shortcomings. Make a small discount on the fact that this is my first site.
</p><p>This is a basic demo website that shows how to use Lektor for a basic
website with some pages and a blog.</p>
